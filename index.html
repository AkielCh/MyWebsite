  <h3>Carbs, one of the sweetest joys in life.</h3>
  <p> For centuries humans have been consuming carbs in their diet. Around the world they are seen in all cuisines. </p>

  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
  </ul>

There are also a lot of foods that people don't realise are high in carbs.
These include:
<ul>
    <li>Condiments</li>
    <li>Fruit</li>
    <li>Some vegetables</li>
    <li>Honey</li>
  </ul>

<div id="top-tips">
  Here are my top 5 tips for eating carbs:
  <ol>
    <li>Kick off the day with whole grains.
      <div>Have wholegrain cereal which is high in fibre and low in sugar.  Or even some good old porridge.
</div>
    </li>
    <li>Leave the white, go for the whole grain.
      <div>Try using wholegrain bread as it is usually higher in fibre.</div>
    </li>
    <li>There’s more to life than bread.
      <div>Or just skip the bread and replace it with things like a quinoa or bean salad. </div>
    </li>
    <li>Who wants sugar water?
      <div>Go for the fruit as a whole over it’s juice counterpart as they usually have much more fibre and less sugar.</div>
    </li>
    <li>Bring on the beans.
      <div>Instead of having potatoes with your food, fill the rest of your plate with beans and get that extra hit of protein.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

  Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity.
